In Python, you can manipulate class attributes from instance methods by referencing theIir class itself. Here’s how it works:

 # Class Attribute vs. Instance Attribute
 .A class attribute is shared among all instances of a class.
An instance attribute is specific to each object.
   # Accessing and Modifying Class Attributes
You should reference the class name or use self.__class__ to modify class attributes from an instance method.

• Class attributes can be accessed and modified within instance methods using `self.__class__`.
  # Example:
  class Car:
      wheels = 4 #class attr

      def change_wheels(self, new_count): 

          self.__class__.wheels = new_count 
           # dynamically refers to the class, making the code more flexible

  
  car1 = Car()
  car1.change_wheels(6)
  print(Car.wheels)  

# When to Modify Class Attributes?
✔ Use class attributes when you need shared data across instances.
✔ Modify them using ClassName.attribute or self.__class__.attribute if changes should reflect across all instances.
✔ Be cautious when using self.attribute, as it creates an instance attribute instead of modifying the class attribute.
